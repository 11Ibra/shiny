## Grunt

Grunt is a built tool that runs on node.js. Once node.js is installed, you can install grunt (run from this directory):

```
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install grunt
```

You will also need to install some modules to run the grunt tasks:

```
npm install grunt-contrib-uglify
npm install grunt-contrib-jshint
```
