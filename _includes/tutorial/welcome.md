## Introducing Shiny


Shiny is a new package from RStudio that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R. Building applications with Shiny has many compelling benefits, including:

* Automatic [reactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming) data-binding between inputs and outputs that makes it possible to build useful applications with only a few lines of code.
* Shiny user-interfaces are "live" in the same way that spreadsheets are live. Outputs change instantly as users modify inputs without explicit programming or requiring a reload of the browser.
* Applications can be built entirely using R, or can optionally make use of custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* A highly customizable slider control that has built-in support for animation.
* Pre-built output widgets for displaying plots, tables, and printed output of R objects.
* Fast bi-directional communication between the web browser and R using the [websockets](http://illposed.net/websockets.html) package.

#### Getting Started

If you've already got the Shiny package installed you are ready to go. If you don't have Shiny yet you'll need to:

* Request access to the beta at [http://shiny.rstudio.org](http://shiny.rstudio.org) 
* Once you have been granted access to the beta download and install the Shiny package from GitHub at 
[https://github.com/rstudio/shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).
